# How to use DMVis in your project

To use DMVis in your project, you will first need to set up a new project using the Svelte framework. Once you have a Svelte project, you can follow these steps to integrate DMVis components and utilities into your project.

## Start a new svelte project

**1**. Install (preferably the lastest version of) [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). Make sure this version is `v20.11.0` or higher, by running `node -v`.

**2**. In your terminal of choice, go to the folder where you wish to create your app.

**3**. Create your app with [svelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/); We recommend you turn on Typescript type checking during the setup process.

## Install DMVis with node

```bash
npm install @dmvis/dmvis
```

To get started with your new DMVis project, or just with the DMVis library in general, follow [Getting started](GETTING_STARTED.md)
