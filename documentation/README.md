# Welcome to DMVis!

## Introduction

Welcome to the DMVis documentation. DMVis stands for interactive multi-criteria "Decision Making with Data Visualisations". It is a library to create interactive data visualisations to aid in decision-making with relative ease. It is open-source and meant to be extended with more visualisations. This documentation provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and guidelines for contributing.

## How to use the library

To use DMVis in your project, you can install it as an npm dependency and import the necessary components and utilities. You can then use these components to create custom decision making visualisations in your project. For more information on how to use the library, refer to the [installation guide](INSTALLING.md).

## What is the goal of DMVis?

DMVis is an innovative platform designed to revolutionise multi-criteria decision making through the power of data visualisations. In the existing landscape, decision making tools frequently restrict users from independently exploring their information space. Users are generally confined to navigating through cumbersome lists or relying on opaque recommendations, as seen in platforms like Funda and Netflix. This project aspires to transcend these limitations by leveraging data visualisations, an impactful but underemployed tool in public domains for multi-criteria decision making.

The need for DMVis stems from two core challenges in the current utilisation of data visualisations. Firstly, the transition of sophisticated visualisation concepts from academic research to functional, user-accessible tools remains a significant hurdle. Secondly, the prevalent visualisation library, D3.js, is seldom integrated into scalable interactive frameworks such as Angular, React, or Svelte.

DMVis aims to empower users to navigate through their decision making processes with greater clarity and insight, leveraging the untapped potential of data visualisations in everyday decision making tools. Additionally, it will serve as a model, enabling future visualisation researchers to augment the gallery with their innovative decision making visualisations by employing the DMVis components. The project will be a step forward in making advanced data visualisation techniques more accessible ultimately empowering people to make data informed decisions in various application domains.

The framework is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to create a wide range of visualisations to suit their needs. DMVis is built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), making it easy to integrate with existing web applications. The project is developed as part of the [Softwareproject](https://softwareprojecten.sites.uu.nl/) course at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/), in collaboration with [Evanthia Dimara](https://www.uu.nl/staff/EDimara/0), an Assistant Professor and a researcher in Information Visualisation at the [Visualisation and Graphics Group (VIG)](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/interaction/visualization-and-graphics/people) at Utrecht University.
