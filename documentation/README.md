# Welcome to DMVis!

## Introduction

Welcome to the DMVis documentation. DMVis is a framework for interactive Multi-Criteria Decision Making with Data Visualizations. This documentation provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and guidelines for contributing to the project.

## What is DMVis?

DMVis is a framework for creating complex decision matrix visualizations. It provides a set of components and utilities that can be used to build custom visualizations for decision-making processes. The framework is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to create a wide range of visualizations to suit their needs. DMVis is built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), making it easy to integrate with existing web applications.

## How to use the library

To use DMVis in your own project, you can install it as a dependency and import the necessary components and utilities. You can then use these components to create custom decision matrix visualizations in your project. For more information on how to use the library, refer to the [installation guide](INSTALLING.md).
