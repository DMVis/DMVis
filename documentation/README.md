# DMVis

Framework for making complex decision matrix visualizations.

## Useful docs

- [SvelteKit docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs).
- [Packaging docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/packaging).

## Prerequisites

We develop inside Visual Studio Code

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

The recommended extensions for Visual Studio Code can be installed by typing
`@recommended` in the extensions tab. Install all the recmmended workspace
extensions.

We have created a `.editorconfig` file to ensure that all developers use the same
settings for their code editor. This is used by the EditorConfig plugin for
Visual Studio Code.

## Setting up

You will need to install the following dependencies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

We have pinned our node version in `.nvmrc` so you can use `nvm` to install the
correct version of node. If you have `nvm` installed (instructions for
[Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and
[Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)),
you can use the following command to install the correct version of node:

```bash
nvm install
```

Once you have installed the above dependencies, you can install the packages
using the following commands:

```bash
npm install --save-dev husky
npm install
```

To maintain code quality, husky is used to run test, linting, and formatting checks
before commits. To enable this, you need to install the git hooks:

```bash
npx husky install
```

## Developing

Start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To build your library:

```bash
npm run package
```

To create a production version of your showcase app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
