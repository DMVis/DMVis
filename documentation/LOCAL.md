# Installation

This project was created using the [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) template. Below are the instructions for setting up the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

We develop inside Visual Studio Code

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

The recommended extensions for Visual Studio Code can be installed by typing
`@recommended` in the extensions tab. Install all the recommended workspace
extensions.

We have created a `.editorconfig` file to ensure that all developers use the same
settings for their code editor. This is used by the EditorConfig plugin for
Visual Studio Code.

## Running Docsify locally

Quite simply run:

```bash
npm run docs
```

## Setting up

You will need to install the following dependencies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

We have pinned our node version in `.nvmrc` so you can use `nvm` to install the
correct version of node. If you have `nvm` installed (instructions for
[Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and
[Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)),
you can use the following command to install the correct version of node:

```bash
nvm install
```

Once you have installed the above dependencies, you can install the packages
using the following commands:

```bash
npm install --save-dev husky
npm install
```

To maintain code quality, `husky` is used to run tests, linting, and formatting checks
before commits. To enable this, you need to install the git hooks:

```bash
npx husky install
```

## Developing

Start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To build your library:

```bash
npm run package
```

To create a production version of your showcase app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
