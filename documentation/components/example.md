# An example of features in Docsify

# Example

Hey, an example of writing documentation here.
This is mainly to show of the features you are able to use within Docsify.

```bash
> this is bash code
```

```html
<p>this is html code</p>
<h1>Code in these blocks gets highlighted!</h1>
```

# This is another header

## This is a sub-header

### This one is even smaller

#### We can keep going smaller

##### But this is the limit

You're also allowed to use emojis :accordion: :100:

# Text highlighting

As you may have already seen,

!> We can give you an **important** message

`and we can highlight sentences or words`

?> _TODO_ Maybe we still have something to do
